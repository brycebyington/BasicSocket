# BasicSocket

### what does it do?
abstracts literally as much as i possibly could from the darwin/posix socket api

### how does it work?

see `Example.swift`

### why

i wanted a near 1-to-1 swift equivalent to python's `socket` and `ssl` libraries for use in my [SwiftBrowser](https://github.com/brycebyington/SwiftBrowser/) project
